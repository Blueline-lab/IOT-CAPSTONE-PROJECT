                                                                                            Introduction
                                                                                            Here i will present the final project from EDX IOT_CAPSTONE module
 I choose to participate in the Team C, the thematic is to 

"Develop an system for give more security in museums"
                                                                                            In this problematic we can define to part, the risk for the museum could be security types (from natural event) or safety types (from human dammage type). The part of security will not be study in this document due to the largest part of this case.

                                                                                            The safety part have equal two parts the malicious dammages and the dammages cause by mistake or uncarrefulness.

                                                                                            By chance this two part could be covered by the same system.
                                                                                            Indeed for protect the objects of the museum we could say "Don't touch" But is not a security measure cause the curiosity will be up of this measure and the malicious person too.

                                                                                            So we have one solution for let the visitors contemplate the objects but prevent any dangerous proximity with the objects.
                                                                                            We should define a safety zone to not pass by any unauthorized persons.

                                                                                            For prevent any violation of the system rules an alarm or flash detection is not a complete measure because malicious person don't care of system alerts.

 The only way for protect the objects after the alert was triggered will be the human presence.


Tis project paper is compose in X parts as follow

1 – Material needed








1. Material needed



List of hardware components :

 

- MCU Raspberry Pico W
3.3v
Wifi connexion
Mini USB Connexion
Support UART, I2C, SPI


The MCU for this project could a Raspberry Pi3 Pi4 but it is too much compute power for the need and too expensive to implement one RPI3 for each object to protect.
It could be decentralized from the object and serve a futhers objects, But the wire management of this type of system give a complexity and follow the building infrastructure that could give problems.

The best way is to implement one tiny cheap MCU by object, RPI Pico W give enouth compute power for two sensors and data transmission.
This one support two threads, could run two loops.
Support Wifi connection
Mini usb connection for upload project.

Finally i choose this MCU beacause it is good documented
The firmwares are  update frequently and easy to update.



 - Motion detection
  I have choose this Motion detector for the system : https://www.digikey.fr/fr/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/SEN-13285/5673793
  I choose it cause it is a good value between price and quality.
  It support the MCU voltage.
  It work with one signal Pin for trigerred the MCU.
  Should able to setting for distance of detection.
  with the one wire signal we could use many pin of the Raspberry Pico W and use several of this sensors for cross the detection zone
  

- proximity detection
    I talk abour proximity sensors in the previous documents.
    But after some research this type of sensors offer a to short detection in a ranger of 3-30mm.
    This type of sensor could not be used in this project.


- Wiring power supply
For powerring this MCU we will need a classic 3.3V converter, but that's mean all the objects of the museums should have wiring power alimentation for connect the 3.3v power supply
It could be a godd idea to take in cost plans a Lipo and charger batterie for the case of hte museum is too old for have electric network add for the project, or in general in the case of any electrical work for this system couldn't be realized.
                                                                                                     
- Server
  For this system, the plan is to implement a server for compute the data collected about alarm triggered.
  We could organize the server with differents hardware, deppend of the client infrastructure :
    Client have a a server rackmount
      We could a a rack in this rackmount for compute the data from our system
        and should include in the price cost this rack
        
     Client don't have any rackmount infrastructure
      we have to deploy a standalone server and include it in the plan cost
      
   Here we can see than the cost for the system will really depend the objects to protect and the infrastructure already build.
   
   We could add than for the server parts the services will run in the "Serverless" categorie for a one Guard office.
   But in 85% of time the services of detection on the server will not consume all the capacity of the server.
  
- wifi






2. Developement

Detection

For program the sensors to send data when they are trigerred we will save a program in the Pico W MCU.
We could choose to make this program in C, C++ or Python
For this paper and for the facility of developement i choose to use Python 3.9
It could be a better way to do it in C++, It could give more complexity and time for develop. But a a C++ program offer a better accuracy about implement and manage sensors.


Firmware
We will upload the firmware Micropython on the MCU
Past the module in boot mode and upload « rp2-pico-w-20230426-v1.20.0 »
After a reboot of the MCU we can acces via Minicom, Thonny, Vscode extension
to a shell from the Pico W.
That’s will help us for doing test.

For run any file at start we will need to name our main script « main.py »


Tools

Thonny IDE
We will need one tool for have direct communication with our MCU, it will be a good way for doing direct test code.

Ampy
We will dowload Ampy tool 
(apt-get install ampy)

This tool offer the possibility to upload and remove permanent files on the MCU.
